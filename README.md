Motion Detected Digital Signage

It was originally created in 2007 to interface a mini-ITX PC to large screens to allow playing back of a given 
playlist of advertisements when someone walked in front of the screen. The original implementation was done with 
Visual BASIC 6 and I'll now attempt to recreate the solution, possibly using a RaspberryPI.
